**Flappy-bird-esque game where you have to jump through obstacles with a twist: _you have to match the colour in the tube to get through._**<br/><br/>

## Build instructions
### **C++**
Must have GCC 12.2.0 installed for compilation, and must be built on Windows.<br/><br/>
Run makefile in root directory with command:
```
make
```
File with name "main.exe" will be built in the bin directory.<br/><br/>
The built executable must be ran alongside all other files (dlls and resource files) in the bin directory.<br/><br/>

### **Python**
Run the .py file in the py-original directory.<br/><br/>
Must be ran with the Python 3 interpreter from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).<br/><br/>

### **Javascript**
Run the index.html file in the js-port directory in a modern internet browser.<br/><br/>
Alternatively, run it hosted on my [itch.io page](https://jamzdev.itch.io/colour-cube).
